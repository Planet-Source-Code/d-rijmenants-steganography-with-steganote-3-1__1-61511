 1. Description
 --------------------------------------------------------------------

 StegaNote is the perfect solution if you need to story confidential
 information on a secure way. This program uses steganography, the
 hiding of information in images, in combination with strong
 cryptography, protected by a password or passphrase.

 StegaNote merges a file, text (from the included text editor) or both
 file and text with a carrier image. The steganographic technique
 changes only one bit in the red, green or blue primary color from
 pixels, leaving the changes totally invisible to human eyes. The 
 cryptographic algorithm, initialized by your secret passphrase, is
 used to select which information bits are place where, spreading them
 all over the image.

 For more information and the program manual, use F1 in the program.
